Connections specifications :

    Whether you need to connect to a stratum pool or to make use of
    getWork polling mode (generally used to solo mine) you need to specify
    the connection  making use of -P command line argument filling up the
    URL. The URL is in the form:

     scheme://[user[.workername][:password]@]hostname:port[/...].

    where 'scheme' can be any of :

    getwork    for http getWork mode
    stratum    for tcp stratum mode
    stratums   for tcp encrypted stratum mode
    Example 1: -P getwork://127.0.0.1:8545
    Example 2: -P stratums://0x012345678901234567890234567890123.miner1@ethermine.org:5555
    Example 3: -P stratum://0x012345678901234567890234567890123.miner1@nanopool.org:9999/john.doe%40gmail.com
    Example 4: -P stratum://0x012345678901234567890234567890123@nanopool.org:9999/miner1/john.doe%40gmail.com

    Please note: if your user or worker or password do contain characters
    which may impair the correct parsing (namely any of . : @ # ?) you have
    to enclose those values in backticks( ` ASCII 096) or Url Encode them
    Also note that backtick has a special meaning in *nix environments thus
    you need to further escape those backticks with backslash.

    Example : -P stratums://\`account.121\`.miner1:x@ethermine.org:5555
    Example : -P stratums://account%2e121.miner1:x@ethermine.org:5555
    (In Windows backslashes are not needed)

    Common url encoded chars are
    . (dot)      %2e
    : (column)   %3a
    @ (at sign)  %40
    ? (question) %3f
    # (number)   %23
    / (slash)    %2f
    + (plus)     %2b

    You can add as many -P arguments as you want. Every -P specification
    after the first one behaves as fail-over connection. When also the
    the fail-over disconnects miner passes to the next connection
    available and so on till the list is exhausted. At that moment
    miner restarts the connection cycle from the first one.
    An exception to this behavior is ruled by the --failover-timeout
    command line argument. See 'eaminer -H misc' for details.

    The special notation '-P exit' stops the failover loop.
    When miner reaches this kind of connection it simply quits.

    When using stratum mode miner tries to auto-detect the correct
    flavour provided by the pool. Should be fine in 99% of the cases.
    Nevertheless you might want to fine tune the stratum flavour by
    any of of the following valid schemes :

    stratum+ssl stratum+tcp stratum1+ssl stratum1+tcp stratum2+ssl stratum2+tcp stratum3+ssl stratum3+tcp 

    where a scheme is made up of two parts, the stratum variant + the tcp
    transport protocol

    Stratum variants :

        stratum     Stratum
        stratum1    Eth Proxy compatible
        stratum2    EthereumStratum 1.0.0 (nicehash)
        stratum3    EthereumStratum 2.0.0

    Transport variants :

        tcp         Unencrypted tcp connection
        ssl         Encrypted tcp connection


Test options:
  -M [ --benchmark ] arg Mining test. Used to test hashing speed. Specify the 
                         block number to test on.
  -Z [ --simulate ] arg  Mining test. Used to test hashing speed. Specify the 
                         block number to test on.


Configuration file details:

Place command line options in a file, for example:

  --api-port 40000
  --report-hashrate
  --HWMON 1
  -P
    stratums://0x2ceCE0...b3caa0F6e86.rig0@eth-us-east.flexpool.io:5555
    stratums://0x2ceCE0...b3caa0F6e86.rig0@eth-us-west.flexpool.io:5555
  -v 7 --display-interval 15


Miner reboots:

    The user may create a reboot script that will be invoked
    if ever the miner deems it needs to restart. That can happen
    if requested via the API, or if the miner detects a hung
    GPU. The script is invoked with 1 parameter, 'api_miner_reboot'
    for API reboots, and 'hung_miner_reboot' for hung GPUs

    The script needs a specific file name and must be first in
    the search path.

    For Linux:   reboot.sh

    For Windows: reboot.bat
```
